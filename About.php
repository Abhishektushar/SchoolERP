					At ABHsolutions, we believe there is a better way to do manage schools as each needs to be digitally empowred. 
					A more valuable, less invasive way where schools entities connect on one Platform. We're obsessively passionate about it, 
					and our mission is to help people achieve it. We focus on ERP based solution. It's one of 
					the least understood and least transparent aspects to make every school Aatma-Nirbhar , and we see that as an opportunity:
					 We're excited to simplify ERP for everyone through our software, education, and community.
